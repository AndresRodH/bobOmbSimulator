![Title](https://github.com/AndresRodH/bobOmbSimulator/blob/master/img/title.png)
Built using Corona SDK, Bob Omb simulator is a simulator game where you spawn Bob-Ombs and make them explode.

This app was built for a presentation for my Applications for Mobile Devices class while attending Lindenwood University.
